    <p>
      System Of A Down was formed in 1995, in Los Angeles. This was following a meeting of the lead singer
      Serj Tankian (born on August 21, 1967 in Beirut) with a young guitarist Daron Malakian (born on July
      18, 1975 in Glendale), which took place two years earlier.

      Although the men were playing in other bands, but they soon discovered that they had similar interests,
      so they began together. They were joined by Andranik “Andy” Khatchadurian, who played the drums and
      together they formed a band named “Soil”. Shortly thereafter, this trio joined Shavarsh “Shavo” Odadjian
      (born on April 22, 1974 in Yerevan, Armenia). This foursome then came up with another band “System Of
      A Down” (SOAD). This name was taken from the poem “Victims Of A Down” by Daron Malakiana. The 
      only change in personnel during this period was to replace Khatchaduriana by John Dolmayan (born on 
      July 15, 1973 in Canada).

      The musical influences of the members of SOAD are very broad. These include both rock, punk, thrash
      metal, death metal, and Armenian folk music. You can also discern in it the elements of jazz. The team first
      registered demo material with compositions “Honey”, “Temper” and “Soil”. It circled the Los Angeles and
      caused a lot of interest in fans even if the work was of an unknown formation. SOAD career gained
      momentum when in 1997 at a concert in the club “Viper Room” in Hollywood, the band caught the
      attention of famed producer Rick Rubin. Soon the band was signed by Rubin’s label American/Columbia
      Records. It is in Rubin’s studio that they began recoding their tracks and then released their debut album
      “System Of A Down” in 1998. This...<a href="http://www.heavymusic.org/category/biography/" target="_blank">System
